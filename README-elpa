2 About the Standard themes
═══════════════════════════

  The `standard-themes' are a collection of light and dark themes for
  GNU Emacs. The `standard-light' and `standard-dark' emulate the
  out-of-the-box looks of Emacs (which technically do NOT constitute a
  theme) while bringing to them thematic consistency, customizability,
  and extensibility. Other themes are stylistic variations of those.

  Why call them “standard”? Obviously because: Standard Themes Are Not
  Derivatives but the Affectionately Reimagined Default … themes.

  Starting with version `3.0.0', the `standard-themes' are built on top
  of the `modus-themes'. This means that all customisation options of
  the Modus themes apply to the Standard themes ([Sample
  configuration]).  Same for all Modus commands that load a
  theme. Enable `standard-themes-take-over-modus-themes-mode' to set up
  this arrangement (or enable `modus-themes-include-derivatives-mode'
  instead to blend Standard and Modus into one collection).

3 Installation
══════════════




3.1 GNU ELPA package
────────────────────

  The package is available as `standard-themes'.  Simply do:

  ┌────
  │ M-x package-refresh-contents
  │ M-x package-install
  └────


  And search for it.

  GNU ELPA provides the latest stable release.  Those who prefer to
  follow the development process in order to report bugs or suggest
  changes, can use the version of the package from the GNU-devel ELPA
  archive.  Read:
  <https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2022-05-13-emacs-elpa-devel/>.


3.2 Manual installation
───────────────────────

  Assuming your Emacs files are found in `~/.emacs.d/', execute the
  following commands in a shell prompt:

  ┌────
  │ cd ~/.emacs.d
  │ 
  │ # Create a directory for manually-installed packages
  │ mkdir manual-packages
  │ 
  │ # Go to the new directory
  │ cd manual-packages
  │ 
  │ # Clone this repo, naming it "standard-themes"
  │ git clone https://github.com/protesilaos/standard-themes standard-themes
  └────

  Finally, in your `init.el' (or equivalent) evaluate this:

  ┌────
  │ ;; Make Elisp files in that directory available to the user.
  │ (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/manual-packages/standard-themes")
  └────

  Everything is in place to set up the package.


4 Sample configuration
══════════════════════

  [ Updated as part of 3.0.0-dev, to build on top of the
  `modus-themes'. ]

  Starting with version `3.0.0', the `standard-themes' are built on top
  of the `modus-themes'. This means that all customisation options of
  the Modus themes apply to the Standard themes. Same for all Modus
  commands that load a theme. Enable
  `standard-themes-take-over-modus-themes-mode' to set up this
  arrangement (or enable `modus-themes-include-derivatives-mode' instead
  to blend Standard and Modus into one collection).

  ┌────
  │ (use-package standard-themes
  │   :ensure t
  │   :init
  │   ;; This makes the Modus commands listed below consider only the
  │   ;; Standard themes.  For an alternative that includes Modus and all
  │   ;; derivative themes (like Standard), enable the
  │   ;; `modus-themes-include-derivatives-mode' instead.
  │   (standard-themes-take-over-modus-themes-mode 1)
  │   :bind
  │   (("<f5>" . modus-themes-rotate)
  │    ("C-<f5>" . modus-themes-select)
  │    ("M-<f5>" . modus-themes-load-random))
  │   :config
  │   ;; All customisations here.
  │   (setq modus-themes-mixed-fonts t)
  │   (setq modus-themes-italic-constructs t)
  │ 
  │   ;; Finally, load your theme of choice (or a random one with
  │   ;; `modus-themes-load-random', `modus-themes-load-random-dark',
  │   ;; `modus-themes-load-random-light').
  │   (modus-themes-load-theme 'standard-light-tinted))
  └────


5 Customization options
═══════════════════════

  [ Redone as part of 3.0.0-dev. ]

  Starting with version `3.0.0' of the `standard-themes', all
  customisation is done via the `modus-themes'. Consult the latter’s
  manual for all the technicalities ([Sample configuration]).
